This is a log of findings during development of the slsa heuristic

Terms
-----
log message
	a string of printable characters, delimited by the operating system
	line terminator.
word	a substring inside a log message that is delimited by specific 
	delimiters, usually whitespace [this definition may need to be
	changed]
subword	a sequence inside a word that is not delimited by the usual word
	delimiters
MSA     multiple sequence alignment (like used in bioinformatics)
motif   a substring inside a log message that is frequently being
	used and has a specific syntax and semantic (e.g. an IPv4 address).
	The term is based on the idea of "sequence motif" in bioinformatics.
parser	(also "motif parser") extracts actual data matching a given motif
	from a log message.

Open Problems
-------------
[P00001] syslog TAG does not work well with common prefix/suffix
detection. The problem is that e.g. PIX tags have integers, which
are detected and Linux logs have process IDs. The PIX integers
are actually part of the constant text, whereas in Linux it is fine
to detect them as variable part.

Open TODO Items
---------------
[T00001] - Dictionary motif
We need to add dictionary motifs, where one can e.g. query users or common words.
It may make sense to ship some "common-word dictionaries". Common word (sets)
are like ("TCP", "UDP", "ICMP", ...) which are often found in firewall messages.
With such words, subword detection does not prove to be helpful, because it
detects a common suffix like [["TC", "UD"] "P"].

[T00002] - URL motif
Logs often contain URLs (and file pathes), just like this:
    193.45.10.119:/techsupp/css/default.css 
We need to find a proper way to identify them. This motif is probably very
broad and hard to specify, especially when thinking about multiple platforms.

Actual Log

- Cisco ASA has ample slighly different formats for specifying interface
  addresses (the faddr, gaddr, laddr parts of message). It looks like the
  log strings are written directly in code, at least we have a lot of
  small inconsistencies which suggest so. This seems to makes it impractical
  to generate a single motif for this type.
- Based on visual review, it looks like pattern detection on a subword-level
  may make sense (e.g. detect IP address, then you'll find a common slash,
  then a port number). This boils down to doing a full MSA on the word level,
  which I tried to avoid for performance reasons.
! [I00001] We may do an subword alignment on some common delimiters like slash,
  comma, colon etc. This can probably be done much faster than a full MSA.
! [I00002] We may also experiment with additional "word-delimiters", optionally
  enable those from the same set as [I00001]. When this is done, we need to make
  sure the delimiter can be stored inside the rulebase (an additional step to be
  taken only of this idea proves to be useful).
